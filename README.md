> A production-quality online judge platform with advanced security features and lockdown exam browser

JudgeLab combines a competitive programming platform with enterprise-grade security, featuring a Windows lockdown agent for secure assessments, comprehensive judging system, and gamification elements.

## üöÄ Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Security-First Design
- **Lockdown Agent**: Windows app with WebView2 that blocks copy/paste, screenshots, and detects AI tools
- **Integrity Monitoring**: Real-time detection of multiple displays, unauthorized processes, and violations
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Docker-isolated judge workers with resource limits and security profiles
- **Network Isolation**: Judge containers run with `--network none` for maximum security

### üèÜ Online Judge Platform  
- **Multi-Language Support**: Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust
- **Advanced Judging**: Custom checkers, time/memory limits, detailed test results
- **Problem Authoring**: Rich markdown editor, test case management, availability windows
- **Timed Assessments**: Configurable solve limits, attempt tracking, late submission handling

### üéÆ Gamification
- **XP & Levels**: Earn points for solving problems, with difficulty multipliers
- **Badges & Achievements**: First AC, speed solves, streaks, clutch completions
- **Leaderboards**: Real-time rankings with seasonal competitions
- **Progress Tracking**: Solve streaks, fastest times, problem statistics

### ‚öôÔ∏è Enterprise Ready
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices with Docker Compose orchestration
- **Database Migrations**: Alembic-managed schema with seed data
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with security scanning and multi-stage deployment
- **Monitoring**: Structured logging, health checks, and integrity audit trails

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend development)
- Python 3.12+ (for backend development) 
- .NET 8.0 (for Windows agent development)

### One-Command Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/judgelab/judgelab.git
cd judgelab

# Start all services
make dev
```

This will:
1. Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
2. Run database migrations
3. Seed initial data (admin, author, sample problems)
4. Launch API, Web, and Worker services
5. Start Nginx reverse proxy

### Access the Platform

- **Web Interface**: http://localhost
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost/api/v1/docs  
- **Admin Panel**: Login with `admin@judgelab.dev` / `admin123`

### Default Accounts

| Role | Email | Password | Purpose |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| Admin | admin@judgelab.dev | admin123 | Platform administration |
| Author | author@judgelab.dev | author123 | Problem creation |
| Student | student@judgelab.dev | student123 | Testing submissions |

### Components

- **apps/api**: FastAPI backend with authentication, problem management, judging API
- **apps/web**: Next.js frontend with Monaco editor, problem browser, submissions
- **worker**: Celery-based judge system with Docker execution
- **agent-win**: Windows lockdown browser with integrity monitoring
- **infra**: Docker configurations, Nginx proxy, database initialization

## üîê Security Model

### Threat Model
JudgeLab addresses academic integrity in online coding assessments:

**Assets**: Student submissions, problem test cases, assessment integrity
**Actors**: Students, instructors, system administrators  
**Trust Boundaries**: Network perimeter, container isolation, process boundaries
**Primary Threats**: Code plagiarism, external assistance, unauthorized tool usage

### Mitigations

| Threat | Mitigation | Implementation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Copy/Paste | Clipboard blocking | Low-level Windows hooks |
| Screenshots | Print screen detection | WH_KEYBOARD_LL hook |
| AI Assistance | Process monitoring | Window enumeration + signatures |
| Multiple Displays | Display detection | Win32 EnumDisplayDevices |
| Network Assistance | Lockdown browser | WebView2 with domain restrictions |
| Code Injection | Sandboxing | Docker with seccomp/AppArmor profiles |
