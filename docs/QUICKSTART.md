# JudgeLab Quickstart Guide

This guide will get you up and running with JudgeLab in under 10 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker Desktop** (Windows/Mac) or **Docker Engine** (Linux)
- **Docker Compose** v2.0+
- **Git** for cloning the repository

Optional for development:
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm** (for frontend development)
- **Python 3.12+** (for backend development)
- **.NET 8.0 SDK** (for Windows agent development)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/judgelab/judgelab.git
cd judgelab
```

## Step 2: Environment Setup

Copy environment files and customize if needed:

```bash
# Copy environment templates
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
cp worker/.env.example worker/.env
```

The default configuration works out-of-the-box for local development.

## Step 3: Start All Services

```bash
# Build and start all services
make dev

# Alternative: use docker-compose directly
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:
1. ‚úÖ Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
2. ‚úÖ Build API, Web, and Worker images
3. ‚úÖ Run database migrations
4. ‚úÖ Seed initial data
5. ‚úÖ Start all services with hot reloading

## Step 4: Verify Installation

Wait for all services to start (about 2-3 minutes), then check:

### Web Interface
- Navigate to **http://localhost**
- You should see the JudgeLab homepage

### API Documentation  
- Visit **http://localhost/api/v1/docs**
- Interactive Swagger UI should load

### Health Checks
```bash
# Check all services are running
docker-compose ps

# Should show all services as "Up"
```

## Step 5: Test the Platform

### Create an Account
1. Go to **http://localhost**
2. Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
3. Create a student account

### Or Use Default Accounts
| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | admin@judgelab.dev | admin123 |
| Author | author@judgelab.dev | author123 |
| Student | student@judgelab.dev | student123 |

### Solve Your First Problem
1. Login as a student
2. Browse to "Problems"
3. Try solving "Sum Array Elements" (easy problem)
4. Submit your solution and see the results!

## Step 6: Windows Agent (Optional)

To test the lockdown agent on Windows:

```bash
cd agent-win
dotnet run
```

This will:
- Launch a locked-down browser
- Monitor system integrity
- Send heartbeats to the platform
- Block unauthorized actions

## Common Issues

### Port Conflicts
If ports 80, 3000, 5432, 6379, or 8000 are busy:

```bash
# Stop conflicting services or modify docker-compose.yml
sudo lsof -i :80  # Check what's using port 80
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Reset database and restart
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up --build
```

### Permission Issues (Linux)
```bash
# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in
```

### Slow Performance
```bash
# Increase Docker memory allocation to 8GB+
# Stop unnecessary services:
docker-compose stop web  # If only testing API
```

## Next Steps

- üìñ Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand system design
- üî® Check [AUTHORING_GUIDE.md](AUTHORING_GUIDE.md) to create problems
- üõ°Ô∏è Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for security features
- üöÄ See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Hot reload development
make dev

# Run tests
make test

# Check code quality
make lint
make format

# Create database migration
npm run migration "Add new feature"

# Reset everything
make clean && make dev
```

## Stopping Services

```bash
# Stop services but keep data
docker-compose stop

# Stop and remove everything (including data)
docker-compose down -v
```
